# ðŸ”„ Force Railway Restart - Bot Commands Fix

## ðŸš¨ Issue Identified
The new `/health` and `/monitor` commands are not working in Telegram, even though they exist in the code and compile successfully.

## ðŸŽ¯ Solution Required
Railway needs to restart the bot service with the new code. This file will trigger a new deployment.

## ðŸ“± Expected Commands After Restart
- `/help` - Should show: `/help, /ping, /status, /health, /monitor, /safe_mode on|off, /system on|off, /check`
- `/health` - Detailed system health report
- `/monitor` - Recent system errors with timestamps

## âœ… Code Verification
```bash
# Verified locally:
âœ… Commands exist in src/tg.ts (lines 187, 217)
âœ… Commands compile successfully to dist/tg.js
âœ… Help text updated to include new commands
âœ… getMonitor import is present
âœ… All dependencies satisfied
```

## ðŸš€ Next Steps
1. This file triggers Railway auto-deployment  
2. Railway restarts the bot service
3. New commands become available in Telegram
4. User can test `/health` and `/monitor` immediately
